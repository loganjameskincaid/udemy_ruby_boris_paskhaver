p 1+4

# this is an expression
# numbers are intergers
# operators are symbols that "do something"
# + is the addition / add operator and so on

p 10 - 6

p 3 * 4

p "school" + "bus"

# this is concatination, where you add two strings together

p 10 / 5

p 12 / 5

# line 18 does not show the correct answer to decimal points
# must use a floating point number (as below) to get accurate return

p 12.0 / 5
p 12 / 5.0
p 12.0 / 5.0

# all of the above give same results


# exponents are a mathmatical operation to find a number to the power
# of another number

p 2 * 2 * 2 * 2

p 2 ** 4

# line 35 shows two the power of 4 which is the same
# as line 33

3 ** 2

# 3 to the power of 2 - so 3 * 3 (multiplying the orginal number *
# how many times)
# eg 5 ** 2 = 25 (which is 5 * 5)
# eg 5 ** 3 = 125 (which is 5 * 5 * 5)

p 5 ** 2
p 5 ** 3

# modulo operator returns the REMAINDER of the operation

p 5 % 2

# 2 goes into 5 two times, which equals 4 - this leaves 1 left over
# modulo returns 1, aka the REMAINDER
